WillMatt's (wmadisonDev) Google Code Jam 2012 Solutions
-------------------------------------------------------

This is simply a little repository for storing my soultions for Google Code Jam 2012! I may periodically look back at this to remember how I approached something algorithmically but mostly this is just for fun for me and an excuse to learn a new language.

All of the source files you'll find here are written in [Go](http://golang.org), which I've found to be a neat little language. Some little quirks I miss from Python but overall I've been very pleased with it :o)

Feel free to fork this and use it as however you choose! Also **follow me** *(if you feel so inclined)*.

Cheers!
